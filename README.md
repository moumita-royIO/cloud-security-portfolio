# ☁️ Cloud Security Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. 
The site is hosted **securely** on **AWS S3** with **CloudFront** and **Origin Access Control (OAC)** to ensure **private** content delivery.

## 📌 Overview

This portfolio:
- Introduces my career objective.
- Lists my technical skills and tools.
- Provides a secure link to download my resume.
- Is fully **static** (HTML/CSS) for fast loading and low cost. The code blueprint was generated by ChatGPT and modified accordingly.
- Is delivered over HTTPS using CloudFront

## 🛠 Steps Followed:

### 1. **Created the portfolio site**
- Built a static HTML + CSS site locally  
- Included sections for my career objective, skills, and contact details.

### 2. **Configured AWS S3**
- Created a private **S3 bucket**. (⚠ Do NOT enable “Block all public access” — keep it enabled.)
- Uploaded all site files (`index.html`, images, resume). 
- Did **not** enable “Static website hosting” since I’m using CloudFront

### 3. **Setup CloudFront with OAC**
- Created a CloudFront distribution  
- Added my S3 bucket as the **origin**
- Enabled **Origin Access Control (OAC)** so only CloudFront can fetch files from S3
- Blocked all public S3 access

### 4. **Configured security settings**
- Forced **HTTPS** via CloudFront
- Added **Custom Error Pages** for better UX
- Set **Default Root Object** to `index.html` (this is must, CloudFront will return a 403 Forbidden otherwise)

### 5. **Tested & Validated**
- Verified that direct S3 URLs return **Access Denied**  
- Confirmed CloudFront distribution loads the site correctly over HTTPS

## 🔐 Advantages of S3 + CloudFront + OAC

- **Security First** – S3 bucket is private, only CloudFront can access it  
- **Performance** – Content cached at AWS edge locations for fast global delivery  
- **Scalability** – Can handle large traffic without extra configuration  
- **Cost Effective** – Pay only for what you use  
- **HTTPS by Default** – Protects data in transit
